## About 

This is a set of helpful scripts, packages and jupyternotebooks for performing lca-related calculations using brightway framework versions less than 2.5. The idea is to share repetitive and complex calculations/plots through scripts, and others as jupyternotebooks that can work once this package is installed via pypi or Github.
